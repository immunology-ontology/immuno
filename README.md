# ImmunO: The Immunology Ontology

ImmunO is a new project intended to become an [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org) ontology for immunology.

## Scope

Following OBO Foundry principles, ImmunO will import existing terms from a number of ontologies:

- CL: Cell Ontology
- PR: Protein Ontology
- GO: Gene Ontology
- ChEBI: Chemical Entities of Biological Interest
- MRO: MHC Restriction Ontology
- DO: Human Disease Ontology
- UBERON: Uber Anatomy Ontology
- OGMS: Ontology for General Medical Science
- exposure ontologies

ImmunO will mint new terms and adopt existing terms that are immunology-specific, such as:

- immune-specific protein complexes: MHC ligand, antigen-antibody complex
- immunological processes: immune recognition, immune exposures
- immunological roles: epitope, antigen, immunogen, allergen (migrate from OBI)
- epitope-specific terms (migrate from OBI)
- species-specific versions of some of these terms
- experimental descriptions, using OBI, Vaccine Ontology
